    <p class="small-header">DEVELOPMENT ETHICS IN HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN:</p>
    <p>
      When designing something there are many aspects that the designer has to
      consider. These include the reason they are making it, who they are making
      it for, and what impacts it may have. Each designer comes to the table
      with different perspectives and biases which affects how they think about
      these aspects. Unfortunately, there is a history of people designing for
      their interests alone, purposely causing negative returns. Some obvious
      examples of this would include Apartheid or the segregation of America’s
      major cities. In both of these examples, systems were designed to not only
      help certain people but to disadvantage the rest of the population.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admittedly, it is difficult to prevent people who choose to design with
      ill intentions. However, we can focus on creating more equitable design
      both on a large and small scale by centering our design on improving human
      dignity for all. In order to manifest these intentions, the concept of
      development ethics has recently evolved as a form of asking these ethical
      questions in development projects. Much like we do in any other field like
      business or medicine, we need to consider if the actions of development
      practitioners are truly beneficial to the recipients, or are serving
      political agendas. Human-centered design assists in this process as it
      focuses on bridging the divide between those designing and those the
      design is being made for. At times this divide is even taken away
      completely. This takes place over a cycle of three steps, as defined by
      IDEO, ‘Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation.”

    <h3 class="small-header">The Short and Simple Version</h3>
    <p>
      Human-Centered Design is the idea and practice of incorporating the
      audience's input into the design process
    </p>
    <h3 class="small-header">The Comprehensive Version</h3>
    <p>
      Human-Centered Design is an innovative approach to the development of new
      ideas or products through the integration of human (those the design is
      intended for) throughout the whole process of design. It is used mainly in
      design but it can be found in fields from engineering to the arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human-centered design is a general concept that lends itself to many
      different industries. In the context of development projects, it shines
      most in the area of personal communication. Once a problem is identified
      you take ‘inspiration’ from communicating with the people that experience
      it on a daily basis as initial research. Through this first step, the
      community’s issues come to life and allow your team to be more invested in
      the people they’re helping and not just the project. Getting to know the
      people that the design is for also builds a rapport between the designer
      and the community. So that they are also invested in the project and
      seeing their goals to fruition.

    <p>
      The following steps of ideation and implementation continue the design
      process without deviating from the human connection aspect. One quote that
      sums the goals of human-centered design well comes from Olivar Delarue who
      worked as the UNHCR, “It is about them and for them. The closer the
      end-users’ needs are analyzed and answered, the more successful the
      adoption or purchase of a solution. You iterate until you get it right
      from a customer perspective. This is the power of HCD.”
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h1 class="large-header">1. Inspiration: Identify the Needs</h1>
    <p>
      The first step of the human-centered design approach is, ‘inspiration.’
      This requires the designer to get to know their audience and the issue at
      hand. In this step, project designers are encouraged to empathize with the
      audience of the potential project and commit to understanding their
      experiences. This step is the foundation of the HCD approach because it
      helps the designer engage with the community they are working with and
      come up with more streamlined solutions that will be more relevant to the
      presented needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are generally two parts to this process in Human-Centered Design:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        ><i><u>Knowing the community:</u></i></b
      >
      To effectively implement the human-centered design approach, one has to
      get to know the community in which the problem resides. In best-case
      scenarios, designers are able to devote time to living in the community
      and experiencing first-hand the issues facing their audience. A designer
      can also perform extensive research on the community, via second-hand
      information. Through these methods, the designers gain a deeper
      understanding of the factors that contribute to the problem in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        ><i><u>Understanding the problem:</u></i></b
      >
      The second aspect of the inspiration process is understanding the problem.
      Why are you choosing to address this issue and how does the problem
      manifest in the lives of the individuals? This aspect often entails
      performing interviews with community members and asking specific questions
      relative to the problem that’s to be solved.

      IDEO is a design studio that has been a leading figure in the field of
      human-centered design. They both incorporate them into their many designs
      and teach the concept to others. One project of theirs that will be used
      as a best practice case study is Asili.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asili is a community-owned health water and agriculture business in the
      Democracy of the Republic of Congo. It was created and set up to address
      the high child mortality rates due to unclean water and in some cases the
      low incomes of the mother. The American Refugee Committee together with
      IDEO partnered to create Asili as a solution to achieve better healthcare
      for children in the Democracy of the Republic of Congo.
    </p>
    <p>
      IDEO project designers were determined to make sure they understood the
      problem of these mothers and were creating a solution that conveyed the
      empathy they had. Consequently, they made a visit to the area and imbibed
      themselves in the community, and had interviews with members of the
      community to hear more about their individual experiences and the possible
      additional determinants that contribute to the high infant mortality
      rates. This guided the development of their solution.

      2. IDEATION: Develop solutions that meet specified needs
    </h1>
    <p>
      The next step in the Human-Centered Design process is to utilize the
      inspiration and ideas from step one in order to begin research, to develop
      various types of strategies and solutions to meet the needs of the
      audience. During this step, it is important to continue working with the
      community to keep your design aligned with their interests.
    </p>
    <p><i>Actions taken in this step can include:</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brainstorm various ideas and decide on the best route</li>
      <li>Begin stages of designs, development, and prototypes</li>
      <li>Collaborate within a focus group in order to receive feedback</li>
      <li>Test out various ideas and prototypes</li>
      <li>Utilize feedback in order to improve ideas and prototypes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This step includes the process of brainstorming and finalizing the various
      types of solutions/ strategies, then discussing and deciding on the best
      solution possible and beginning the first steps in testing out these
      ideas. This can include incorporating your target group in your
      development of prototypes and testing solutions within the community or
      organization you plan to work with.
    </p>

    <h1 class="large-header">
      3. IMPLEMENTATION and EVALUATION: Real-World Trials & Making Improvements
    </h1>
    <p>
      The last step of the Human-Centered Design process can in some cases be
      the most lengthy of the three. Research, interviewing, and creating a
      prototype take time but testing and tweaking them is where time should
      really be invested. By this point the prototype will most likely not be
      complete but ready to be tested in the field.
    </p>
    <p>Benefits from fielding testing:</p>
    <p>
      <i><u>Time to engage with the people (and their culture):</u></i
      >Feedback, feedback, feedback! The goal of your project is to support
      communities to live more fulfillingly, no matter what aspect of life you
      are helping. The only way to solve their problem effectively is to receive
      human input from the community. Although the first prototype is based on
      earlier feedback it is still affected by your own biases and experiences.
      Through community testing, you can adjust the prototype to be in line with
      the needs and cultural norms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        ><u
          >Experience problems that can not be replicated in a design studio:</u
        ></i
      >Depending on the goal of your project your prototype could be any matter
      of things. It might be a social media campaign, a business, a device that
      will help banana farmers fight diseases wiping out their crops, or a
      toolkit. In all of these cases, the real test of their endurance is
      putting them in the ‘real world’. This way they will be able to encounter
      problems that are either difficult to recreate or could not have been
      thought of otherwise.

      There are many design studios that base their work on the ideology of
      human-centered design. The most well-known would be IDEO.org, which also
      generously share their ideas with the general public through handbooks and
      games. They have worked on projects from a refugee camp feedback system to
      a financial app for teenagers. Through their projects, they aim to put
      people first and reach inclusive and innovative outcomes.
