                    <p>
                        The Project Evaluation Tool aims to assist in assessing the ethicality of development projects based on the 7 values of worthwhile development: well-being, equality, empowerment, human rights, cultural freedom,
                        responsibility, and sustainability. To utilize the Project Evaluation Tool for scoring a project, assess how well the project reflects each value of worthwhile development on a scale from 1-5. For each criterion,
                        consider the level of attention and commitment, identifying any shortcomings or areas that require improvement. Assign scores accordingly, ensuring consistency in judgment across all criteria. After completing the
                        individual assessments of each value, calculate the overall score by summing up the scores from each criterion and dividing by the total number of criteria. This final score will categorize the project as Inadequate,
                        Developing, Adequate, Exemplary, or Exceptional, providing a comprehensive and nuanced evaluation of its ethicality across various dimensions
