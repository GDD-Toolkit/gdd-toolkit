            <h4>What is Developmental Ethics and Maldevelopment?</h4>
            <p>
                Developmental ethics involves how human rights, basic needs, and social 
                justice are met throughout any form of the development process. Being 
                ethical, honest, and fair, is one of the basic human needs. It is important 
                to make sure that when development is taking place throughout the globe, no 
                matter the economic condition, culture, or religion of the country, ethics is 
                still a major focus. The concept of “development” was originally and is 
                often understood in the context of economic growth or improvement. Historically, 
                Development Planners focused on raising gross domestic product (GDP) and other 
                measures of financial success. (Goulet, Development Ethics a New Discipline, 
                1997, p. 1) However, beginning with the work of Denis Goulet and Louis-Joseph 
                Lebert in the 1970s, scholars have expanded upon the practice of development 
                through the field of “development ethics.” (Devulin, 2012, p. 218) According 
                to the United Nations Human Development Programme, development must first focus 
                on human improvement. (Ross-Larson & Hanlon, UNDP Human Development Report 1990, 
                p. iii) Goulet concurs, explaining that a nation’s success in development depends 
                on “many social, cultural, political, and psychological determinants.” (Development 
                Ethics a New Discipline, 1997, p. 1) 
            </p>

            <p>
                Developmental ethics revolves around Jay Drydyk’s seven worthwhile values: 
                well-being, equality, agency and empowerment, environmental sustainability, 
                human rights, cultural freedom, and responsibility. Each of these values 
                are important because they all work together to benefit development as a 
                whole. Well-being, equality and agency and empowerment go hand in hand because 
                all of them focus on how the development of the module or toolkit will directly 
                impact the citizens in that area or the individuals utilizing the toolkit. 
                Environmental sustainability is extremely important when developing because we 
                want our development to be able to last. If our development tactic negatively 
                affects the environment, it will have to be removed because we only get one 
                earth and we need to conserve and protect it. Both human rights and cultural 
                freedom are also extremely important to consider for development. We do not 
                want to impinge on an individual’s rights or cultural groups freedom because 
                it is unethical. The last value is responsibility. It is essential to be 
                responsible when developing and in the toolkit because our proposed strategies 
                can impact others in many ways, which needs to be accounted for. Each of 
                these values are crucial to conserve when developing in a country, city, or 
                area because they provide the citizens, who are being impacted, with a form 
                of protection. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Failure to consider these determinants can therefore lead to development that 
                harms the populations it is supposed to benefit, called “anti development” or 
                “maldevelopment.”According to Goulet, anti-development destroys or harms cultures 
                and individuals, (Development Ethics a New Discipline, 1997, p. 9) and it can be 
                the cause of “ecological disaster, which strips nature of its regenerative vitality” 
                (International Ethics and Human Rights, 1992, p. 239). Additionally, anti development 
                occurs in “the name of profit, some absolutized ideology, or a supposed efficiency 
                imperative” (Goulet, 1997, p.9).  Essentially, cases of anti-development involve 
                projects that destroy cultures, people, or ecology, for the sake of profit gain, 
                ideological gain, or efficiency.

                Our mission is to find a way to ensure that all organizations and governments, 
                whether they are public or private, are held accountable, and abide by the development 
                ethics guidelines we develop and put forth.

            <h3>What is Development? What are Ethics? What are Development Ethics?</h3>
            
            <h3>Development:</h3>
            <p>
                a process of which results in the growth and progress, economically, physically, 
                politically, socially. Advancing the overall state of the subject.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethics:</h3>
            <p>
                the moral principle that helps govern one’s actions and assists in discerning between what is 
                “right” and what is “wrong.” It helps one navigate whether actions are moral in practice. 
                Essentially it is something that we all use in a different form, everyday, and is what is 
                used to support one’s doings.
            </p>

            <h3>Development Ethics:</h3>
            <p>
                the constant review of the ends, means and practices of development on a local, 
                national or global scale.
            </p>

            <h3>Approaches:</h3>
            <p>
                Evaluative:  assesses progress in terms of tangible improvements that can physically be 
                evaluated such as a decrease in poverty, increased access to health care, increased education,
                 the measuring of gross national product, advances with technology, industrialization, etc.
                <br>Effectiveness:  achieving development is dependent on the free agency of the people. This is 
                why with development ethics one must keep the people in mind and make sure that the projects 
                are relevant to them.
            </p>

            <h3>Field of Development Ethics:</h3>
            <p>
                The field of development ethics is based on the academic work of many scholars, which are 
                important to understanding the purpose of ethical development. One of the founding Development 
                Ethicists was the development planner Denis Goulet, who wrote that the materialistic and 
                purely economic view of development was lacking and harmful in the 1970s (Deneulin, Ethics 
                and Development, 2012, pg 218). Goulet described development ethics as “a question of values 
                and human attitudes, self-defined goals, and criteria for determining what are tolerable 
                costs to be borne in the course of change,” (Development Ethics A New Discipline, pg 2), 
                countering the predominant view of development at the time as the process of “identifying 
                and quantifying the composition of economic growth packages.” (Development Ethics A New 
                Discipline, pg 1) Goulet further described the core of ethical development, by explaining 
                that, “<b>every person and society wants to be treated by others as a being of worth, for its 
                own sake and on its own terms, regardless of its utility or attractiveness to others.</b>” 
                (Goulet as cited in Gasper, 2006, pg. 1) This is a good way for readers to examine the concept 
                of ethics in development, and one that should be strived for in the Global Development and 
                Design Toolkit. Humans want to be respected and understood, not just viewed as a means to an 
                end or a tool in an economic strategy. Therefore, while development may aspire to help a 
                struggling economy, it must never solely be focused on economics and always put the people first.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another important figure in the field of development ethics is the economist and philosopher 
                Amartya Sen. Sen created the framework of the “<b>capability approach</b>,” which is of great 
                importance to ethical development. (Deneulin, Ethics and Development, 2012) The “capability 
                approach” suggests that “<b>social arrangements should be primarily evaluated according to the 
                extent of freedom people have to promote or achieve functionings they value.</b>” (Alkire, The 
                Capability Approach and Human Development, pg. 6) Essentially, the capability approach is when 
                situations are evaluated based on the actual freedoms people have and not based on the number 
                of resources that they possess or hold on paper. Severine Deneulin of the University of Bath 
                highlights the contradiction between capabilities and resources through the example of a family 
                that “may have considerable assets but the daughters may not go to school because of social norms 
                that hold that a woman’s place is at home.” (2006, pg. 220) In this scenario, the daughters do 
                not have the freedom to attend school because of the societal norms and traditions of the local 
                populace, limiting their capabilities. Another example of this concept could be a town that 
                nominally has access to public transportation, but due to conflict and frequent terrorist attacks, 
                the people feel intimidated enough to avoid using it. The “capability approach” is thus essential 
                to Development Ethics because it allows development planners to analyze what is limiting the 
                freedoms of others and how to improve the capabilities that people have.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scholarship of development ethics has changed the way project planners conduct development worldwide. 
                In 1990, the United Nations Development Programme started compiling an annual Human Development 
                Report, which is strongly influenced by the development ethics field. These reports are an excellent 
                introduction to the problems that still need to be addressed by development ethicists, and to the 
                motivations that should drive it. In the introduction to the first-ever Human Development Report, 
                it explains that development is “<b>more than GNP growth, more than income and wealth and more than 
                producing commodities and accumulating capital,</b>” and that “human freedom is vital for human development.” 
                (Ross-Larson & Hanlon, 1990, pg. 1)  The report additionally introduced the Human Development Index 
                (HDI), an aggregate of several basic capabilities that reflects the progress of development more 
                accurately than the Gross National Product (GNP). (Ross-Larson & Hanlon, Human Development Report 
                1990, 1990) Development planners should incorporate HDI targets into their planning, instead of solely 
                relying on GDP and GNP, as these can be misleading as to the true capabilities that a nation’s citizens 
                face.

                Question Number 1 serves as the principle question that one must ask themselves before embarking on a 
                development project. If the answer both number 1 and 2 are “No” it is strongly encouraged that one should 
                reconsider thoughts of development. If the answers on questions 3-7 are “Yes” it is also encouraged to 
                reconsider thoughts on development. However, If the answer to question 1 is “yes” regardless of whether 
                the people called for development it is encouraged to begin project planning, and give back the basic 
                rights that they were deprived of.

                The 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, though it predates the field

                Martha Nausbaum is another major contributor to the field of development ethics who expanded 
                upon Sen’s capability approach. Her 2000 book, Women and Human Development, explores not only 
                issues of feminism and development, but also of what capabilities everyone should have access 
                to. (Nussbaum, 2000)
            </p>

            <p>
                To summarize, development ethics puts emphasis on adhering to the people and their needs. First, 
                come the assessment of human rights and whether they are adhered to. The capability approach can
                 be utilized to determine the actual freedoms that individuals have, and what needs to be developed 
                 to improve their capabilities. If development ensues, constant communication should be held with 
                 the target population to receive input on the development. Developers should be mindful to ensure 
                 that people are treated with respect and not reduce people to objects as part of a strategy. 
                 Including these central focuses of global development allows for a better understanding of 
                 cross-cultural values and to further implement the goal of Development Ethics. Additionally, users 
                 can check out the development ethics checklist provided, to help in planning for development.
