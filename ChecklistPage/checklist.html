            <p class="info">
                This checklist is designed to address each of the 7 values of worthwhile development 
                as they relate to the four categories of ethicality, desirability, feasibility, and 
                viability. The checklist provides a framework in creating progressive projects that 
                will benefit the overall community, and is intended to be used as a final evaluation 
                before implementing the project.

            <p class="info">This checklist provides a final evaluation for developers to determine whether their 
                project meets all seven values of worthwhile development, with regard to the four 
                categories of ethicality, desirability, feasibility, and viability. The criteria for 
                each value incorporates questions that relate to these categories. To use the checklist, 
                determine how the project addresses each of the criteria and score the completed 
                checklist with the methodology linked above.

            <p class="info">The development ethics checklist aims to provide developers with a final evaluation to 
                determine whether their project meets all seven values of worthwhile development. 
                Therefore, discussing how the checklist fits into the global development toolkit can 
                be viewed as a final check when evaluating a project proposal generated using the 
                business ethics canvas AI. In planning and implementing future projects, the checklist 
                can be a valuable tool for ensuring that projects adhere to global development standards 
                and the values of worthwhile development as outlined in the Routledge Handbook of 
                Development Ethics.
