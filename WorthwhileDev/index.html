          In order for development in other countries to be worthwhile, there
          needs to be seven goals or values that the developers must have.
          Integrity is something that is very important to worthwhile
          development, making it valuable, especially because corruption is
          involved. It damages the well-being of individuals because it
          preserves, expands, or produces inequalities along with making the
          whole situation disempowering. These goals help “work out an evolved
          notion of development and to propose alternative models to
          governments, international agencies, non-governmental organizations
          (NGOs), and communities.” (Encyclopedia, 2022). In order to improve
          the country that is working on development, there need to be multiple
          factors that influence the development. By including these seven
          factors or goals, it is possible to track the progress of developing
          countries, no matter how difficult it may be, on a scale, or as we
          have created, a scorecard. These seven factors are well-being,
          equality, empowerment, human rights, cultural freedom, responsibility,
          and sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well-being, the first of the seven factors of development ethics, is a
          way of having things go well for a group of individuals in the country
          or the country itself. The factor helps improve relationships between
          individuals, indicating how people choose to treat each other based on
          agreements or disagreements. Well-being is critical to development
          ethics and the corresponding scale because understanding a citizen’s
          situation and feelings in a certain country can help determine if
          development is positive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equality is defined as “the state of being equal, especially in
          status, rights, and opportunities.” (Oxford Dictionary). In multiple
          developing countries, equality is an issue that is very difficult to
          fix. There are multiple factors that may influence someone’s decisions
          as to why certain things are not equal and certain things are. If
          equality, especially in status and rights, continues to grow in
          developing countries, then the levels of inequality should decrease as
          well.
        </p>
        <p id="italics">
          Empowerment gives citizens and people, in general, the ability to be
          subjected to their own development and not just people who are looked
          down upon or passed by without a second thought. If real development
          is taking place in a certain country or state, individuals in that
          state should feel the comfortability of shaping their own life, rather
          than live how the government encourages them to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human rights are probably one of the most, if not the most important
          of the seven factors for effective and worthwhile development. There
          are many arguments that human rights can be suspended for the sake of
          consistent development, but the UN has declared that development must
          be supportive of human rights. Depending on how many opportunities and
          rights each individual has in a developing state, can determine if the
          country is slowly making progress toward the end goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Human Development Report 2004, cultural freedom is the
          freedom to be who we are and who we want to be. This movement of
          cultural freedom is also influencing the reduction of social
          exclusions; making sure that everyone is accepted for who they are and
          what they choose to do with their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multiple ways to represent responsibility in a state,
          depending on the cultural values of that state. For example, there are
          ethical responsibilities to letting actors and stakeholders become
          involved in global development, creating a huge debate between wider
          responsibilities such as ending world hunger and world poverty. There
          are multiple issues when it comes to deciding who has to take
          responsibility for certain things. When certain countries find a
          solution to balancing responsibilities correctly, the score of the
          country’s improvement can determine if those roles have greatly
          influenced the development or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to sustainability, there are multiple subcategories that
          can be involved. For example, one of those subcategories can be
          environmental sustainability, which is asking if this development is
          going to affect future generations from living a life in the same
          area.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Because of the value it places on human well-being and equity,
          development ethics is not especially amenable to more biocentric
          approaches, in which other species, ecosystems, or the land are valued
          intrinsically. However, living with concern for and in relation to
          animals, plants, and the world of nature has been identified as
          central to human well-being by Martha Nussbaum (who, like Sen, is
          cited by development ethicists, but does not identify herself as
          one).”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sustainability shows researchers and policymakers alike how well these
          developments are going to work in the next ten, twenty, and maybe even
          fifty years.
        </p>
        <p>
          By quantifying each of these factors, we are able to look at policies
          and how ethical they would be in any context.
